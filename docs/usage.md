# Using llx

The everyday reference: the command line, a session's keys and slash commands, sign-in and
models, and how sessions are kept. For the short version see the [README](../README.md).

## Command line

`llx` opens a session at the terminal, and `llx exec` (or `-p`) runs one task and exits. `llx decide` asks one question about stdin and prints the option the decision model picked.

```bash
llx                                                        # a session at the terminal
llx "fix the failing test in src/parse.rs"                 # a session that starts with this task
llx -c                                                     # go on with the newest session here
llx exec "fix the failing test in src/parse.rs"            # one task, then exit (also: llx e, llx -p)
llx exec -y "run the tests and fix what fails"             # allow commands and edits without asking
llx --mode plan "how should we split src/parse.rs?"        # read-only: change no file
git diff | llx -p "review this change"                     # piped stdin is added to the prompt
llx exec - < task.md                                       # the prompt from stdin
llx exec -y "fix the lint" </dev/null                      # from a script whose stdin stays open
llx exec -C ../site "open http://localhost:3000 and check that sign-up works"
llx exec --json -y "update the changelog" | jq -c 'select(.type == "tool.call")'
llx exec --schema '{"type":"object","properties":{"version":{"type":"string"}},"required":["version"]}' \
    "which version is this crate?"                        # the data alone on stdout
llx exec resume --last now update the README               # one more task in the newest session
git diff | llx decide "Does this break the public API?"    # yes or no, in about a second
```

With `exec`, given a PROMPT, stdin that is not a terminal is read to its end and added to the
prompt, and llx says so on stderr. A caller whose stdin stays open (a harness with a pipe, `ssh`
without `-n`, a `while read` loop) should pass `</dev/null`.

### Options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-C, --cd DIR` | The workspace: paths resolve in it and files change only inside it. Default: the current directory. |
| `--mode MODE` | A named set of rules: `default`, `plan`, `bypass`, or your own from `settings.json` (see [Modes and approvals](modes.md)). Also `--permission-mode`. Default: `default`. |
| `--allow RULE`, `--deny RULE` | Add a rule to the mode's for this run: `bash(cargo test *)`, `apply_patch(docs/**)`, `jobs` ([the syntax](modes.md#rules)). Repeat them. A deny refuses in every mode, `-y` included. |
| `-y, --yes` | `--mode bypass`: allow commands and file changes without asking. Also `--yolo` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Giving it with `--mode` is a usage error. |
| `-p, --print` | Run the prompt as one task and exit, as `exec` does. |
| `-c, --continue` | Go on with the newest session of this directory, as `resume --last` does. |
| `--json` | With `exec` or `-p`: one JSON event per line on stdout (see [`--json`](reference.md#json-events)). |
| `--schema SCHEMA` | With `exec` or `-p`: end with data matching this JSON Schema (inline, or `@file`), printed alone on stdout. |
| `-o, --output-last-message FILE` | With `exec` or `-p`: also write the final answer, or the data with `--schema`, to FILE. With `--schema` and no data that matched, the file is left empty. |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show each tool result and model turn in the trace. With `--json`, the trace also goes to stderr. |
| `--provider PROVIDER` | Where the agent's chat model comes from: a provider of the model catalog by id: `openai` (a ChatGPT sign-in or a key), `openrouter`, `anthropic`, `deepseek`, `xai`… Env `LLX_PROVIDER`. Default: the one `/login` saved, else the one signed in to. |
| `-m, --model MODEL` | The agent's chat model, a model id of the provider's (any OpenRouter id works). Env `LLX_MODEL`. Default: the one `/login` saved, else `gpt-6-luna` on OpenAI and `anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5` on OpenRouter. |
| `--reasoning LEVEL` | How much the chat model reasons: `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` or `ultra`, as far as the model takes it (a level it does not take is a usage error; `/login` lists its levels). Env `LLX_REASONING`. Default: the one `/login` saved for that model, else the model's own. |
| `--decision-model MODEL` | The decision model `llx doctor` checks. Env `LLX_DECISION_MODEL`, default `~typesafe/jev-latest`. |
| `--max-turns N` | Model turns for one task (50; 1 to 10000). |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | Seconds one task may take (1800; at most 86400). It stops at the first model turn past them, or while the task waits on its monitors or agents. Time spent waiting on you (an approval, a question) does not count. |
| `--no-daemon` | Run the session in this process instead of the daemon (`llx serve`). Env `LLX_NO_DAEMON=1`. `exec` always runs in process. |

### Commands

- `logout`: forget every saved sign-in: the ChatGPT tokens and the OpenRouter key. (Signing in is `/login` in a session.)
- `sessions`: list the saved sessions, newest first, with the directory each ran in.
- `exec [PROMPT | -]` (alias `e`): run one task without a session and exit, with the answer alone on stdout. `exec resume [ID | --last] [PROMPT]` runs one more task in a saved session. In CI, the [GitHub Action](ci.md#the-github-action) runs it.
- `decide QUESTION`: ask the decision model one question about stdin (`--choices a,b,…` instead of yes or no, `--expect CHOICE` to exit 1 on any other, `--json` for the probabilities and the cost) and print the option it picked. No agent, no tools; it needs an OpenRouter key. The [reference](reference.md#llx-decide) has its options and exit codes.
- `resume [ID | --last] [PROMPT]`: go on with a session at the terminal. `--last` is the newest session that ran in this workspace (else the newest of all, with a note).
- `doctor`: check that everything a run needs is in place.
- `serve`: the daemon the sessions run in (unix). `serve status` says whether it runs (its pid, its build, the terminals attached, the sessions open and working, those moved to the background, the jobs; exit 1 when none runs), `serve stop` ends it, stopping every session's task first.

## In a session

A session needs a terminal on stdin that its interface can draw on; without one (or where the
interface cannot start) it is a usage error pointing to `llx exec`, which prints the same blocks
(each call, the answer, how it ended) without the live part.

### The screen

- What finished goes into the terminal's own scrollback, so scrolling, selecting and copying are the terminal's. Only the bottom is redrawn: the call running, `Working (12s · esc stop)`, the messages you queued meanwhile, and the prompt `❯`.
- Under the prompt, a list shows the session, the agents it started (as a branch) and the jobs running; with no agents it is gone. Time and tokens follow each row's status. The other sessions take one line, `← 2 other sessions (1 working, 1 waiting for you)`.
- ↓ from an empty prompt gives the list the keys: ↑↓ choose, Enter or → shows an agent's transcript, `x` stops an agent or a job, Esc or ← go back.
- Each session gets a short title from its first task, made in the background by the same model at its lowest reasoning level (the task never waits for it), shown in the list and saved with the session.
- A successful `apply_patch` shows an inline diff with old and new line numbers, context, and red and green bands that fill the row, also in the scrollback. Long lines wrap; large previews are bounded and marked when cut.
- Markdown answers support tables with aligned columns, wrapped cells and inline styles. On very narrow terminals, cells are shown vertically.
- Consecutive successful calls of the same tool are joined with `↳`; failures and questions stay distinct.

### Typing

- Enter sends. Shift+Enter, Ctrl-J or a line ending in `\` start a new line; a paste keeps its lines. Up and Down walk earlier entries.
- While a task works, Enter sends what you type to it, read at its next step (`↳`); Tab keeps it for after the task (`⏎`).
- Ctrl-R finds the last earlier entry with the words already typed (type them first; again for older ones). Ctrl-G writes the entry in `$EDITOR`. Ctrl-U clears the line before the cursor. Shift+Left and Shift+Right select (with Alt or Ctrl, by word; Shift+Home and Shift+End to the line's ends): Backspace or Delete deletes the selection, and typing or a paste replaces it. Ctrl-Z (unix) gives the terminal back and stops llx, as vim does; the shell's `fg` continues it with the screen drawn again, and the session's tasks go on meanwhile.
- Leaving (Ctrl-C twice, Ctrl-D, `/exit`) prints, dim under the history, `Resume this session: llx resume <id>` for each session with a task, the one shown first; moving to the background says to run `llx` in this directory to come back.
- Clipboard text shows as `[Paste]` (numbered for several) and is expanded when sent.
- Shift+Tab goes round the modes (default → plan → bypass → your own → default) without Enter; while a task runs, the switch waits until it ends.

### Stepping back: Esc and Ctrl-C

Esc and Ctrl-C each undo the innermost thing open, one step at a time; Ctrl-C also stops work. In order: a line typed in a question goes back to its options; a search's query is cleared (Ctrl-U clears it too); a list or a question closes (an approval: Esc answers no, Ctrl-C answers no and stops the task); a step of `/login` goes back to the one before; in an agent's view Ctrl-C stops that agent alone, then goes back to the main view; a task running stops (while it stops, a second Ctrl-C quits at once, as the footer says); a draft is cleared (↑ brings it back); and on an empty prompt the first Ctrl-C says `ctrl-c again to quit`, the second quits (asked first while work runs). Ctrl-D on an empty prompt quits too.

Each list's last line names only the keys that do something there, each with what it does: `tab provider · ←→ reasoning · enter select · esc cancel`.

### Attaching files

- Drag a file into the terminal or paste its path: a picture (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, up to 8 MB) becomes `[image: shot.png]`, sent to the model as one from a copy kept in `~/.llx/pasted`; anything else becomes `[file: notes.md]`, sent as its path for the agent to read. Several at once work.
- `@` followed by a few letters lists the workspace's files; Enter or Tab puts the chosen path in.
- Ctrl+V attaches the clipboard's picture (macOS).
- `-i FILE` (`--image`) attaches pictures to the first task, in a session or in `exec`; a file that is missing or not a picture is a usage error before any model is called.

### Slash commands

Typing `/` lists them. Tab completes the selected command (with a trailing space for `/mode` and `/permissions`); Enter runs exactly what is typed.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/login` | Signs in, and chooses the provider, the model and its reasoning level (see [below](#signing-in-and-choosing-a-model)). |
| `/model` | Chooses the model and its reasoning level. |
| `/mode [name]` (also `/permissions`) | Lists the [modes](modes.md) or switches to one. |
| `/new` (also `/clear`) | Opens a new session and shows it, even while a task works; the old one goes on in the background. |
| `/status` | The models, the workspace, the mode, the session |
| `/rewind` (also `/undo`, or Esc Esc on an empty prompt) | Goes back to before one of the conversation's tasks: the files `apply_patch` changed (the agents' too; not what commands changed), the conversation (the task's words back in the prompt; the session's agents are let go), or both. |
| `/diff` | The changes since the last commit, new files too. |
| `/init` | Writes an `AGENTS.md` for the project. |
| `/copy` | Copies the last answer that says something. |
| `/usage` (also `/cost`) | What the session spent. The footer's right end says it all along (`24.1k in · 87% cached · 1.2k out · $0.042`), a resumed session's earlier tasks included. |
| `/help`, `/exit` (also `/quit`, or Ctrl-D) | Help; leave. |

### Several sessions

- Each session is recorded in its own file, and Ctrl-C stops only the one shown.
- ← on an empty prompt lists the sessions in this project: those open (working, then waiting for you, then idle or done), "+ New session", then this directory's saved sessions, newest first. ↑↓ choose, Enter or → opens one (a saved one is resumed in a session of its own), `x` stops a session's task without switching to it, Esc or ← close the list.
- At most 8 are open: another closes the oldest idle one.
- An approval or a question from a session not shown names it (`session <name> (in the background)`), ignores keys for 300 ms and is answered as any other; its own choices wait until it is shown.
- When a session not shown finishes, the one shown says `● Session "…" finished · ← to open`.

## Signing in and choosing a model

`/login` asks for a provider (every one of the catalog in one list: the popular first, then the current one and those signed in to, then the rest by name; `✓` marks those signed in to or with a key set; type to search by name or id), signs you in to it, then opens its model list (↑↓ choose the model, ←/→ change its reasoning level, Enter confirms). Each step is titled by its path (`Login › OpenAI › Model`), and Esc goes back one step, as you left it; at the providers it ends /login. Once a sign-in is saved, Esc at the model goes back to the providers, and ending there says you are signed in and which model is still in use.

- **OpenAI**, with a ChatGPT sign-in: your browser opens OpenAI's sign-in page and comes back to llx on `127.0.0.1:1455` (or 1457), and llx goes on by itself, with nothing to paste; requests are billed to your ChatGPT plan, and `/login` and `/model` offer the models the ChatGPT backend serves, those it serves alone too. On a machine without a browser, open the address shown elsewhere and paste the address the browser ends on.
- **OpenRouter**, with a key: paste it (it is not shown), or sign in in the browser for a new one. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` works too, and wins over a saved key.
- **Any provider of the model catalog** (Anthropic, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, Moonshot, Z.ai, Together, Fireworks… about 200), with a key: paste it, or set the variable models.dev names for it (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`…), which wins over a saved key. OpenAI takes an API key too. Each is called over OpenAI's chat completions at the address the catalog gives.

The models, their context windows, reasoning levels and defaults come from one catalog, models.dev's ([MODELS.md](../MODELS.md)): its files for the popular providers are built in, and a session fetches its newest data in the background, at most once an hour; what it fetches is listed a minute later. Each request's cost comes from the catalog's prices when the provider reports none (a ChatGPT plan's as its API-equivalent value).

`/model` chooses among the models of every provider signed in to, each provider a tab over the list (`OpenAI 36 · [OpenRouter 288]`, with how many models each lists): Tab and Shift+Tab switch, and the list opens on the current model's. ←/→ change the highlighted model's reasoning level inline, and Enter confirms both. The current model keeps its level, and other models start at their own defaults. A list longer than 12 is searched by typing (Backspace edits the query, Esc clears it, then cancels; `/model`'s search finds a model by its name or id in every tab, each tab counting its matches, and goes to the tab of the best one when the tab shown has none) and scrolls with ↑↓, PageUp, PageDown, Home and End. Shift+Up and Shift+Down move the level without a menu.

The choice is put in at once, in the same conversation, and saved as the default for later sessions and for `exec`.

## Sessions and the daemon

Every run is saved as a session in `~/.llx/sessions/<id>.json`; set `LLX_SESSIONS` to keep them elsewhere. A session records each task and how it ended, but not the conversation itself. `resume` therefore starts a new conversation that is told the earlier tasks, and the directory they ran in; at the terminal, the earlier tasks and their answers are drawn first (the last 20). In a session, each task continues the same conversation.

A session at the terminal runs in a daemon, `llx serve`:

- One per config directory, found at a socket in `$TMPDIR/llx-<uid>/` (a directory only you may enter), started by the first `llx` (detached, in a session of its own, its errors in `daemon.log` beside the sign-ins, what it did in `logs/llx.log`) and attached to by every later one.
- It holds the sessions with their agents and jobs, and the models; `llx` draws, reads the keys and speaks to it over the socket.
- Each terminal's sessions work in its directory, with its environment, and with the options its command line gave. Each terminal has its own questions, and quitting one names only its own work.
- A session is open at one terminal at a time: resuming one open at another says so.
- Closing a terminal stops its sessions' work; the daemon lives on until `llx serve stop`.
- A plain `llx` in a directory where sessions were moved to the background comes back to them; `llx` with a task, `resume` or any option opens new sessions beside them, which wait for the next plain `llx`.
- A daemon of another build is stopped and replaced only when nothing needs it (no terminal attached, no session open or moved to the background, no task, monitor or schedule); otherwise the session runs in this process, and llx says so, as it does when the daemon cannot be reached.
- `--no-daemon` (or `LLX_NO_DAEMON=1`) always runs in process, and so does `exec`.

The design is in [daemon.md](daemon.md).

## Project instructions

llx reads instruction files, so a repository that already has them works as it is:

- your own, for every project: `~/.llx/AGENTS.md`;
- the project's: in each directory from the git repository's root down to the workspace, the first of `AGENTS.override.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, root first, so a deeper file wins over a shallower one;
- a directory below the workspace: its file comes with the result of the first `read` or `apply_patch` of a file there, and covers that directory's tree.

A line that is only `@path` brings that file in (relative to the file, or `~/…`), three levels deep, each file once, as in CLAUDE.md. The task you give wins over every file. Each file is capped at 16 KiB and those read at the start at 32 KiB together, with a note when something was cut. They reach the agent in a context block with the environment: the workspace, the OS, the date and the mode.

### The prompt cache

The context is built so the prompt cache keeps working. It is a message of its own after the system prompt, the same for every task and session in a workspace on a day (the date has no time), and it is marked for the cache, so a new session reads it from there. Files are read once per session; a subdirectory's file is appended with a call's result; a mode change is a note appended later; the states older tool results carry and the pictures older calls left are dropped together once past a budget, not one at a time. Nothing earlier in the conversation is rewritten turn by turn.
