//! What the interface and the server say to each other (ARCHITECTURE.md W1-W8). Wire types only:
//! no logic, no workspace crate. The server tells what happened in a session ([`Event`]) and asks
//! the person ([`Asked`]); the interface calls the server ([`Command`]) and answers ([`Reply`]).
//! Every frame is one of [`ToClient`] or [`ToServer`], the same in process and over a socket.
