//! The terminal interface: what a person sees and types. Finished blocks go into the terminal's
//! own scrollback once (so scrolling, selecting and copying stay the terminal's); only a small
//! live area at the bottom is redrawn. Every block is a pure function from state and width to
//! styled lines, which the snapshot tests pin.
//!
//! One thread owns the terminal: it reads the keys (from a reader thread), takes the server's
//! frames through a [`Client`], and draws. The sessions run in the server; the interface knows
//! them only by what the protocol carries (ARCHITECTURE.md L7).
