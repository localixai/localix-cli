//! What a refreshed model catalog costs a run as it starts. models.dev lists hundreds of
//! providers and thousands of models, and a run uses one: `llx decide` reads none of them, and
//! `llx exec` decodes only what it uses. What is counted is memory, the peak a run reaches with a
//! large catalog against the same run without one: unlike time, it is the same on a loaded CI
//! machine as on a laptop, and it is what a daemon keeps for as long as it lives.
