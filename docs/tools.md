# Tools

llx has five tools. The set is deliberately minimal: a new capability goes into one of them (as
an `action`), or is left to the shell. The model works as you do at a terminal: it reads with `cat`,
`sed -n` and `rg` and runs the checks in the shell, and changes files with a patch, as free text with
nothing to escape. Its context names the script runtimes found on the session's `PATH` (`python3`, `node`, `bun`, only
those present) in a `Runtimes:` line.

| Tool | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| [`bash`](#bash) | Commands that run to their end: reading, searching, running checks |
| [`apply_patch`](#apply_patch) | Files added, changed, deleted or moved, with a patch |
| [`ask`](#ask) | A question to you |
| [`agents`](#agents) | Other agents, in parallel |
| [`jobs`](#jobs) | Monitors and schedules |
| [`result`](#result) | Only with `--schema`, after the work: the data in your shape |

## bash

- `sh -c` in the workspace or a `workdir`, with stdin closed. On Unix it runs in its own session, with no terminal, so a program that prompts fails at once; git and pagers are told not to prompt or page.
- The model reads what Codex's `shell` returns: `Exit code: N`, `Wall time: 0.4 seconds`, then `Output:` with stdout followed by stderr as one stream (a timeout reads `Timed out after: …`, a signal `Killed by signal: N`, a stop `Stopped: by the person`; a `workdir` adds `Directory: …`, a cut output `Total output lines: N`).
- A timeout (120 s by default, at most 600 s) or Ctrl-C kills it with everything it started.
- Each stream keeps about 40,000 characters: the first 8,000 and the last 32,000, cut at lines. A non-zero exit is a normal result. It asks the gate. In a read-only mode its commands run in an operating system sandbox instead ([modes](modes.md#modes)); a command that writes a file fails there.
- The key variables of the provider in use (as the catalog names them, such as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` are left out of a command's environment; other providers' variables stay, so a project's own tests can use them; a provider chosen later with `/login` has its variables left out too, from the next command on. That is no barrier, since a command can still read llx's own environment (`ps -E` on macOS; on Linux llx marks itself non-dumpable, so only root can read `/proc/<llx pid>/environ`, and a hosted CI runner gives passwordless `sudo`) and the saved key file. Where `bash` runs on input from strangers, see [CI security](ci.md#security).

## apply_patch

- A patch as free text, `*** Begin Patch` … `*** End Patch`: `*** Add File`, `*** Delete File`, `*** Update File` (with `*** Move to`), each update's hunks found by their lines and the lines around them. Where the provider takes a tool of free text held to a grammar (the ChatGPT sign-in, for a model the catalog says takes one), it is offered so; elsewhere as a function with the patch in one string. Every file is worked out and asked of the gate before any is written; a hunk that does not fit changes nothing.
- The model reads Codex's summary: `Success. Updated the following files:` and one line a file, `A path`, `M path` or `D path` (a move is `D old`, `A new`). The diff is shown to you in the terminal, never sent to the model; a failure says why and that no file was changed.
- Writes are atomic (a new temporary file, then a rename) and keep CRLF line endings and permissions; a read-only file is refused, and a file with other hard links is written in place.
- It asks the gate, refuses to write when the file changed while the question was open, and changes only files inside the workspace, never llx's own. In a read-only mode (`plan`) a patch is refused: a file written cannot be sandboxed.

## ask

One to three questions to you, in a session only (not in `exec`). Each is shown with its options to pick with the arrows or a number (a question that allows several answers toggles them with Space, then Enter), and a last one to type your own answer; Esc skips it, and Ctrl-C stops the task. It asks no gate: it changes nothing.

## agents

Starts other agents and works with them, in parallel:

- `spawn` (a task, and a short name) starts one on a thread of its own and returns at once; `send` tells one more (read at its next step while it works, or a new task once it is done); `wait` (some or all, `timeout_ms`, 30 s by default) returns the answers that came; `list` shows them; `close` ends one (at most 6 open).
- An agent's answer, its final message, reaches the main agent by itself at its next step as an `<agent_result>` message; a task does not end while its agents work.
- An agent is a session of its own whose parent is the main one: its conversation opens with the same context, it has the same tools but `agents`, `ask` and `jobs` (one level, and nobody to answer it), and asks the same gate, its approvals marked `[agent name]` and asked one at a time. It sees nothing of the main conversation.
- It stops with the task (Ctrl-C, the time limit) or alone (`x` on its row), and what it spends counts in the task's turns and cost (and in `--json`'s `turn` events and `usage`).
- Its tasks are saved as a session that names its parent; `llx sessions` lists the main ones with how many agents each started, and `resume` never picks an agent's.

## jobs

Work that comes back later.

- `monitor` runs a command in the background (approved like a command, in its own process group, without the key variables `bash` leaves out): each batch of lines it prints reaches the main agent as a `<monitor>` message, at its next step while a task runs, else as a task of its own. It ends when the command exits, at its deadline (5 min by default, 30 at most; 10 in `exec`, where the task waits for it) or with `stop`, and the agent is told.
- `schedule` gives a `prompt` back as a task of its own at a time: `in` (`45m`, `2h`) or a 5-field `cron` in local time (`*/10 * * * *`, `0 9 * * 1-5`; both day fields restricted match either), once or `recurring` (for 7 days at most). It runs between tasks, behind what you queued, while the session is open (not in `exec`; not restored by `resume`; no jitter).
- At most 8 monitors and 50 jobs. `list`, `stop`.

## result

Not offered while the model works: a task ends when it replies with a message and no tool call. With `--schema`, llx then asks the same model once more, on the same conversation, for a `result` call carrying `data` that matches the JSON Schema, with `tool_choice` forced to it. Data that does not match goes back to be fixed, up to two times; then the run ends `no_data` (exit 1). See the [reference](reference.md#exit-codes).
