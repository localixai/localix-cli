# MODELS.md

How llx knows models: a Rust port of [models.dev](https://github.com/anomalyco/models.dev)
(branch `dev`), studied from a clone of the repository (commit `b2ac700`, 2026-10). This is the
reference for `packages/providers/models`; ARCHITECTURE.md A4 makes it the one source of
model facts.

## models.dev, as it is built

**Two kinds of files, TOML, schema 2** (`AGENTS.md` of models.dev; `packages/core/src/schema-v2.ts`):

| | Lab model | Provider model |
|---|---|---|
| Path | `models/<lab>/<model>.toml` | `providers/<provider>/models/<model>.toml` (a `/` in the id is a folder) |
| Holds | facts true on every host: `name`, `description`, `family`, `open_weights`, `knowledge`, `release_date`, `[modalities]`, `[capabilities]` (`tools`, `reasoning.supported`, `temperature`…), `[limit]` | how one host serves it: reasoning controls, `cache`, `structured_output`, `system_updates`, `effort_updates`, `service_tier`, `[cost.*]`, `status`, `[api.*]`, and only real overrides |
| Identity | the file path (never an `id` field) | the file path; `base_model = "<lab>/<model>"` names the lab file |

A provider file of a model the provider did not make **must** use `base_model`; a full inline
definition is only for a lab serving its own model or a model unique to the host.

**Resolution** (`generate.ts` `mergeBaseModel`, `generate-v2.ts` `withV2Fields`):

1. Start from the lab model without `id`, `benchmarks`, `license`, `links`, `weights`.
2. Deep-merge the provider file over it: tables merge key by key; arrays and primitives replace.
3. Drop each dotted path in `base_model_omit` (e.g. `limit.input`).
4. `modalities` are the provider file's when it has them, else the lab's.
5. `id` is the provider file's path, `canonical_id` its `base_model`, `type` defaults to `chat`.

**`provider.toml`**: `name`, `npm` (the AI SDK package: it decides the protocol), `env` (the key
variables), `api` (the base address; required for `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`), `doc`,
`opencodeai`.

**APIs** (`generate-v2.ts` `toApiV2`, `resolveProtocol`, `toModelApis`): a model's `[api.<protocol>]`
tables are its whole list of APIs, in order, replacing the provider's default. A table's
`base_url` comes from the table, else the provider's `api`, else the SDK's default address
(`DEFAULT_NPM_BASE_URLS`, e.g. `@ai-sdk/xai` → `https://api.x.ai/v1`); a trailing `/` is dropped.
Without tables, the one default API's protocol comes from `npm`:

| `npm` | protocol |
|---|---|
| `@ai-sdk/anthropic` | `messages` |
| `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/azure`, `@ai-sdk/xai` | `responses` (`chat-completions` with `shape = "completions"`) |
| `@ai-sdk/google` | `generate-content` |
| anything else (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral…) | `chat-completions` |

`compatibility.reasoning_field` names where a chat-completions host returns reasoning
(`reasoning_content`, `reasoning`); `replay_reasoning` says whether it must be sent back.

**Reasoning controls** (`capabilities.reasoning`, per host): `supported`; `effort` (graded, from
`none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, sorted low to high: `none` is off);
`toggle = true` (on/off by a request field); `budget = { min, max }` (a real reasoning-token
budget); `default = { type = "effort", value = "high" }` (optional). None of these: always on, no
control.

**Cache and mid-conversation flags** (per host): `cache = false`, or `implicit` and/or `explicit`
(`ttl`, `max_breakpoints`, `targets`, `min_tokens`). `system_updates`: a system message mid-
conversation is accepted in place, the cache kept. `effort_updates`: a per-turn effort change
keeps the cache. `tools.updates`: tools can be added mid-conversation, the cache kept. Published
as `true`/`false` (an unset flag is `false`).

**Cost**: USD per million tokens. `[cost.text.input]` `price`, `cache = { read, write }`;
`[cost.text.output]` `price`; `[[...overrides]]` by `when = { context = { gt = 272_000 } }` (the
long-context price band; the reason llx's default request ceiling is 272k);
`[[cost.multipliers]]` by service tier.

**Status**: `alpha`, `beta`, `deprecated`. **Type**: `chat` (default), `image`, `video`,
`embedding`, `reranking`, `decision`, `transcription`, `speech`, `realtime`.

**Published** (`packages/web/src/server.ts`, `packages/function/src/worker.ts`):

- `https://models.dev/api.json`: v1, flattened and frozen ("never break v1"): `reasoning_options`,
  `limit`, `cost.input`… (5.9 MB, ETag).
- `https://models.dev/experimental/v2.0/api.json`: v2, resolved: per provider `{id, name, env,
  doc, models}`, per model the merged lab + host fields, `capabilities` (reasoning with `default`,
  `cache`, `system_updates`, `effort_updates`, `tools.updates`), `limit`, the structured `cost`, and
  `api` with every protocol's `base_url` (9.8 MB, ETag). Marked experimental.

## llx's port: `packages/providers/models`

- **Data:** `data/` holds models.dev's own files, verbatim and with their source comments, for the
  providers llx lists first and the lab files they name: `data/providers/<id>/provider.toml`,
  `data/providers/<id>/models/...`, `data/models/<lab>/...`. `scripts/models_sync.py <clone>`
  copies them from a models.dev clone (`git clone -b dev`), keeping per provider the newest models
  llx can work with, and every decision model it serves (the browser's hands are one); nothing in
  `data/` is edited by hand.
- **Build:** `build.rs` resolves the files as models.dev does (the rules above, in Rust) into one
  document in the shape of the v2 API, cut to the fields llx reads, built into the crate.
- **Run:** `lib.rs` types that shape (unknown fields ignored; a model that does not parse is left
  out, never the catalog). `source.rs` fetches the v2 API at most once an hour with its ETag, keeps
  it cut down in `<config>/models.json`, and lays it over the built-in data: the next session
  sees it. Nothing waits on the network.
- **What llx reads:** a model is usable when its `type` is `chat`, `tools.supported`, `text` is
  among its outputs and it is not `deprecated`. Its window is `limit.input`, else
  `limit.context`. Its levels come from `capabilities.reasoning` (effort list, toggle → off and
  on, budget → low, medium, high, and off when its `min` allows) and its default from `default`,
  else medium or the nearest below. A provider is called through the first API llx speaks:
  `chat-completions` (any host), `responses` (OpenAI with a ChatGPT sign-in, which offers the
  models served over it alone too). A `decision` model that is not `deprecated` is kept for the
  browser's hands: the app's default one (`DECISION_DEFAULT`) must be among them.
- **Kept for later strategies:** `cache` and the `*_updates` flags (whether a mode or level
  change keeps the prompt cache), the long-context price band.

## Fidelity

`cargo test -p models` checks the resolution on small fixtures. With a fetched v2 API,
`MODELS_DEV_V2=api.json cargo test -p models -- --ignored` compares every built-in model with
models.dev's own resolution of it, field by field, and fails on any difference in what llx reads.
