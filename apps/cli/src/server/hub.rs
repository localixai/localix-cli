//! every client attached and, unless it is live only, into a bounded ring under its number
//! ([`ring`]), so a client that attaches later gets what came after its cursor (or, when the
//! ring no longer reaches it, a gap and every session's state first), then the questions still
//! waiting.
//! A client whose channel is closed is dropped; none is waited for (the socket cuts slow ones).
//!
//! Frames leave in the order they were posted, the same for every client, yet no lock is held
//! while one is sent (R6): posting appends to an outbox under the lock, and one thread at a time
//! (whoever finds no one else at it) empties it outside the lock.
