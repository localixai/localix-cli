# Reference

Exit codes, the `--json` events and `llx decide`. Both the exit codes and the events are a public contract.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The task was achieved, or the agent answered without saying it was not |
| 1 | The agent answered that the task was not achieved, or the data did not match `--schema` |
| 2 | Turns or the time limit ran out before an answer |
| 3 | The environment or the command line is not ready: no key, no network, a model error, a bad argument |
| 130 | Interrupted: Ctrl-C (or SIGTERM) |

With `--json`, a closed stdout (`llx --json ... | head -1`) ends the run quietly at its next turn, with exit 0. Without it nothing is written to stdout until the answer, so the run goes on to its end and then exits 0.

## JSON events

`--json` (with `exec` or `-p`) prints one event per line on stdout, in the order things happen. Every event has a `type`, and `ms` is the time since the task started.

| Event | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| `run.started` | `schema` (5), `goal`, `session`, `model`, `workspace` |
| `tool.call` | `id`, `name`, `arguments` |
| `tool.result` | `id`, `name`, `failed`, `fatal`, `output`, and `state` when the tool left one |
| `turn` | One model turn: `model`, `input_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cost_usd`, `model_ms` |
| `run.completed` | `status` (`achieved`, `not_achieved`, `exhausted`, `error`, `interrupted`), `exit_code`, `answer`, `data` or `data_error`, `error`, `session`, `usage` {`agent`, `cost_usd`}, `duration_ms` |

The exit codes and these events are a public contract. A breaking change bumps `schema` and is listed in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## llx decide

`llx decide QUESTION` asks the decision model one question about what comes on stdin and prints the option it picked. It is one request: no agent, no tools, no session. It needs an OpenRouter key (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or one saved with `/login`) and answers in about a second, for a fraction of a cent.

```bash
git diff origin/main... | llx decide "Does this change break the public API?" --expect no
git log -1 --format=%B | llx decide "What release is this?" --choices "patch,minor=a new feature,major=a breaking change"
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--choices A,B,…` | The options, comma-separated, at least two. `key=what it means` tells the model more. Given more than once, each `key=…` is one option whole, commas and all. Default `yes,no`. |
| `--expect CHOICE` | Exit 1 when the model picks any other option. It must be one of the choices. |
| `--json` | Print the whole answer as JSON instead of the option alone. |
| `-m, --model MODEL` | The decision model. Env `LLX_DECISION_MODEL`, default `~typesafe/jev-latest`. |

Stdin is read to its end when it is not a terminal, up to 256 KiB as `exec` reads it. The question is sent with the instruction that the input is data to judge, never instructions to follow.

The output is the option alone on stdout, and a newline. With `--json` it is one object:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `choice` | The option picked |
| `confidence` | The model's own confidence in it |
| `probabilities` | Each option and its probability |
| `model` | The decision model that answered |
| `cost_usd` | What the request cost |
| `millis` | How long it took |

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The option was printed, and with `--expect` it is the expected one |
| 1 | `--expect` names another option than the one picked |
| 3 | Not ready: no OpenRouter key, no network, a model error, or a bad argument (fewer than two choices, an `--expect` that is not a choice) |
