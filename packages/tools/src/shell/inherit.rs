//! What a command inherits of this process: its standard streams, and no other descriptor.
//!
//! Everything this process opens is meant to close on exec, but some descriptors are made in two
//! steps, opened and then marked: on macOS std's pipes and sockets (it has no `pipe2`). A command
//! another thread forks between the two steps inherits the descriptor, and a background process
//! it starts keeps it as long as it lives: another command's output pipe, which then never ends, or the pipe std's `spawn` reads to
//! learn whether exec succeeded, which keeps that `spawn` waiting until the background process
//! dies. A descriptor this process itself inherited open would reach every command the same way.
//!
//! So between fork and exec every descriptor above stderr is marked close-on-exec. The standard
//! streams are in place by then (std moves them before it runs the hooks), and std's own pipe for
//! exec's error is close-on-exec already: it stays open until exec, which closes it as it should.
