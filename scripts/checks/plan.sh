# Which checks a change needs, chosen from its paths alone: `plan MODE COVERAGE` reads
# `path<TAB>present|gone` lines on stdin and prints `check<TAB>scope<TAB>why` lines in the one
# fixed order below. The same paths give the same plan: no clock, no network; the workspace's
# crates and their edges come from `cargo metadata --no-deps`, which reads the manifests only.
# Sourced by scripts/check; scripts/checks/check_test.sh holds the rules' examples.
#
# MODE is `fast` (the cheap subset, for hooks), `changed` (what a change needs) or `all` (every
# check, the whole workspace: what CI runs). Rust's scopes are cargo's: `-p` per crate, or
# `--workspace` when a file every crate reads changed (the root manifest, the lock, clippy.toml,
# the toolchain).

# Every check, in the order they run.
