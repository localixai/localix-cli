//! The composition root: the one place that builds the packages and hands them to the agent
//! through its ports. [`compose`] builds the chat model; [`assemble`] builds the rest around any
//! model: the brake, the workspace, the mode's gate, the person, and the tools: `bash`,
//! `apply_patch`, `ask` in a session, `agents`, `jobs`. What it starts (threads, monitors) is closed when `assemble` returns,
//! before `main` exits (which would skip their `Drop`).
