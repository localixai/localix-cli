//! `jobs`: work that goes on in the background and comes back to the conversation later. A monitor runs a command and gives each batch of
//! lines it prints to the main agent: at its next step while a task runs, else as a new task. A
//! schedule gives its prompt as a task of its own when due, between tasks, behind what the person
//! queued. Both live as long as the session (a monitor until its deadline); in `exec` a task waits
//! for its monitors, and schedules are refused: the process ends with the task.
