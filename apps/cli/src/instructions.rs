//! The instruction files the agent follows, found under the names repositories already use for
//! coding agents:
//!
//! - the person's own, for every project: `~/.llx/AGENTS.md`;
//! - the project's: in each directory from the repository's root down to the working directory,
//!   the first of `AGENTS.override.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (a deeper file comes later and
//!   wins);
//! - a directory below the working directory may hold its own: the prompt says to read it before
//!   working there.
//!
//! A line that is only `@path` brings in that file, as in CLAUDE.md. Everything is read once
//! and only ever appended, so the conversation's prefix, and the prompt cache, stay as they were.
