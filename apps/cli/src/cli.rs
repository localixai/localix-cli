    llx <COMMAND>";

const ABOUT: &str = "llx: an ultrafast, lightweight agent runtime: a minimal agent for the terminal, helpers on any model, and a decision step for scripts and CI";

const LONG_ABOUT: &str = "llx: an ultrafast, lightweight agent runtime. A minimal agent for the \
terminal (llx), one task for scripts and CI (llx exec), and a decision step (llx decide).

It works in a directory (the current one, or -C DIR) with its tools: exec, a short JavaScript \
script that reads files and runs commands (each run to its end), apply_patch, a patch that \
changes files, ask, a question to you (in a session only), agents: other agents it starts in parallel, each a session of its own (in a \
session, a list under the prompt shows them: down arrow, then enter to see one), and jobs: \
monitors (a background command whose lines come back) and schedules (a prompt at a time).

With no command, llx opens a session at the terminal: PROMPT, when given, is its first message, \
and each line you type goes on from the last. `llx exec` (or -p) runs one task without a session \
and exits, with the answer alone on stdout: for scripts, CI and pipes.

To sign in, type /login in a session: choose a provider (OpenAI, signed in with ChatGPT in \
your browser, or OpenRouter, with a key), then one of its models and a reasoning level that \
model takes (left/right in the model list, Enter confirms both). The choice is saved as the \
default for later sessions and for exec. `llx decide`'s decision model runs on OpenRouter, so it \
needs an OpenRouter key.

Rules decide what runs without asking: a deny refuses, an allow runs it, and anything else is \
asked at the terminal (1 yes, 2 always for this tool, 3 no; outside a session y, a or n), or \
refused with no one to ask. A mode (--mode) is a named set of rules: default (none), plan \
(file changes refused), bypass (-y, everything allowed), or your own from `modes` in \
~/.config/llx/settings.json. --allow and --deny add rules for one run: bash(cargo test *), \
apply_patch(docs/**). In a session, /mode switches it and Shift+Tab goes round the modes \
(after the task if working); the mode is always shown under the prompt, and /status shows it \
too. Markdown tables wrap their cells \
to the terminal width; completed edits show numbered diffs with red/green background bands. Tab completes a slash command \
(with a space for commands taking an argument); Enter executes the typed command. Pasted text \
is shown as [Paste] until sent; pasted file paths become file or image marks.

Sessions run side by side: /new opens another and shows it while the one before goes on in the \
background. The Left arrow on an empty prompt lists the sessions in this project (those open, a \
new one, then the saved ones): Enter opens one, x stops its task, Esc closes the list. A question \
from a session not shown names it. Quitting while a session works or a shell, monitor or \
schedule runs asks first, naming them: Exit and stop tasks stops them all.

Ctrl-C stops the task of the session shown (the command running is \
killed, and an open question or approval ends); a second Ctrl-C quits.

On unix a session runs in a daemon, `llx serve`, which the first `llx` starts and later ones \
attach to: it keeps the sessions, and lives on when a terminal closes (whose \
sessions' work then stops) until `llx serve stop`. --no-daemon runs the session in this process; \
exec always does.";
