//! The desk: the lanes of a session at the terminal. Each lane is a whole session of its own
//! (its conversation, agents, jobs and stop) on a thread of its own, over what they all
//! share (the workspace, the session store). The person opens one with `/new`
//! and the others go on in the background. The desk ends when the last lane does, and when one
//! panics the others are stopped, so a scope never waits for ever on a lane at its prompt.
