//! A run, as a session at the terminal or one `exec` task: all is checked and read on the main
//! thread first (workspace, schema, key, prompt), then the session is composed. A session at the
//! terminal is the daemon's (`llx serve`, docs/daemon.md) unless `--no-daemon`: this process is
//! then its client, and the daemon runs the same code for it (`At::Served`). Each task is run,
//! reported and recorded; Ctrl-C stops it (see `interrupt`), not the process.
