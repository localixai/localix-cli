//! Quitting while work runs: Ctrl-C twice, Ctrl-D and `/exit` ask first when something runs (a
//! session's task, a shell, a monitor, a schedule), naming each as the server says it. "Exit and
//! stop tasks" stops every session and ends llx; "Move to background and exit", offered only by a
//! server that keeps work once the interface leaves (a daemon's), leaves it running there; "Stay"
//! (or Esc) closes the question.
