//! - [`auth`]: signing in (PKCE in the browser, a local callback) and refreshing the tokens.
//! - [`tokens`]: the tokens, the account they belong to, and the file they are kept in.
//! - [`responses`]: the chat port over the Responses API of the ChatGPT backend.
//!
//! It knows nothing of the app that uses it beyond the [`App`] it is given.
