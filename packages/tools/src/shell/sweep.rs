//! Every process of a session, killed by its session id. A command's shell leads a session of its
//! own, and one signal to its process group ends only that group: a shell with job control (an
//! interactive shell in a terminal, or `set -m`) puts each job in a group of its own, and a job
//! running in the background gets no hangup when the shell dies. Every process keeps the session
//! it was started in unless it calls `setsid` itself, so the session id finds them all. The
//! session's id is its leader's pid, which stays taken while the leader is not reaped, so the
//! sweep runs before the leader is reaped and never reaches a recycled pid.
//!
//! On macOS the processes are listed into a table on the stack with one system call; on Linux
//! they are the numbered entries of `/proc`.
